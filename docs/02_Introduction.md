# Introduction

## Background

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, effective project management has become crucial for the success of software development teams and organizations. Traditional project management tools often fall short in providing the real-time collaboration, intuitive user experience, and scalable architecture needed for modern development workflows.

Orbit was conceived as a solution to address these limitations by creating a comprehensive project management platform that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge technologies with user-centric design principles.

## Problem Statement

Modern development teams face several challenges with existing project management solutions:

### 1. Limited Real-time Collaboration
- Lack of simultaneous editing capabilities
- Poor conflict resolution mechanisms
- Delayed synchronization across team members

### 2. Complex User Interface
- Steep learning curves for new users
- Inconsistent design patterns
- Poor mobile responsiveness

### 3. Scalability Issues
- Performance degradation with larger teams
- Limited customization options
- Inflexible role-based access controls

### 4. Integration Challenges
- Poor integration with development tools
- Limited API capabilities
- Vendor lock-in concerns
