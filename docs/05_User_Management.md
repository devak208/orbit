# User Management

## Overview

User management is a core component of the Orbit project management platform, providing essential functionalities for handling user accounts, authentication, roles, and permissions.

## Registration and Authentication

### User Registration
- Users can register via email and password.
- Optional registration via third-party providers (Google, GitHub).
- Email verification to confirm account ownership.

### Authentication
- Password-based login with bcrypt hashing for security.
- OAuth2 integration for Google and GitHub authentication.
- Session and token-based authentication using NextAuth.js.

### Session Management
- Sessions are managed using JWT tokens with a 30-day expiration.
- Secure storage of JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies.
- Auto-refreshing tokens to extend session longevity.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Roles and Permissions
- Four primary roles: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer.
- Granular permissions based on roles.
- Owner and Admin have full project rights.
- Member can contribute to projects and tasks.
- Viewer has read-only access to project content.

### Permission Matrix

## User Profile Management

### Profile Settings

- Bio and location fields for enhanced user profiles.
- Timezone and notification preferences.

### Avatar and Images
- Support for avatar uploads and image cropping.
- Default avatars for users without custom images.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing.
- Encrypted token storage and transmission.
- Regular security audits for maintaining best practices.

### Auditing and Logging
- Activity logs for user actions and changes.
- Monitoring for unauthorized access attempts.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-factor authentication support.
- Custom role creation for flexible permissions.
- Integration with more authentication providers.
